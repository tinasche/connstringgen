# connstringgen

"connstringgen" is a simple, static extension to generate connection string when developing apps that require a database connection locally. Right now it only supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Sql Server and Sqlite3. Primarily developed for use in .NET application development but future work will support other database engines.

## Features

This first version is static, that is to say, it will produce the same connection string format everytime. This is ideal for a start as these are the settings I use presently! 
> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Future Work

- Support for more database engines.
- Interactive flow to describe attributes for a connection string  i.e., authentication details, connection information, etc
